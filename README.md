## DEPRECATED

**QuickReturn** is deprecated. No more development will be taking place. At the time of creating this library <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.html">CoordinatorLayout</a> did not exist.  Please check out <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.html">CoordinatorLayout</a> as you should be able to implement all the similar functionality that is in this library with the help of <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.Behavior.html">Behaviors</a>.

Thanks for all your support!
